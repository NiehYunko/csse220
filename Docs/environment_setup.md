# Install Java and Eclipse on your computer

For those of you who are sophomores/juniors/seniors, if you 
still have your original laptop configuration Java and Eclipse 
should already be installed.  (It's still good to check of course).  
Freshman and anyone who doesn't have eclipse should follow the 
instructions here: 
[Installing Eclipse](https://hewner.github.io/csse220/Docs/installing_eclipse.html)


# Checkout the public CSSE220 git repo

Everyone should follow the instructions here:
[Clone CSSE220 git repo](https://hewner.github.io/csse220/Docs/getting_the_repo.html)


If you have any trouble, contact your course instructor.
